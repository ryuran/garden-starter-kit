Browsersync: Proxyfy JS and CSS files
===============================================================================

Browsersync allows to synchronize navigation (click, scroll, â€¦) between several devices.

The _Garden Starter Kit_ do not use [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/) anymore.

But if you want continue to use it you can use [browser-sync-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/Va1/browser-sync-webpack-plugin) (look at ["Advanced" section](https://github.com/Va1/browser-sync-webpack-plugin#advanced)).
